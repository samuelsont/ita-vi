### Summary

The visually impaired have little or no effective visual sensory input and have to rely on external assistance for navigation. Several electronic travel aids were developed to aid independent navigation of the visually impaired though these travel aids either offered some level of obstacle recognition or terrain analysis but not both. However, dangerous terrain features pose serious risks of hazard.

This paper proposes the design and implementation of an Intelligent Travel Aid that combines the detection and recognition of objects with the analysis of terrain features for real-time identification of features that may pose a risk of hazard to visually impaired users.
This system will use machine vision for object recognition and terrain feature detection. Two cameras for capturing object and terrain images respectively, a haptic device and a speaker connected to a Raspberry Pi development board form the core of the system. The system will notify users of obstacles and terrain features via haptic feedback and synthesized speech.

To visualize the terrain data and obstacle position in space during initial analysis and model fitting, cMapIT.io studio software will be employed. For real-time analysis of the surrounding environment, OpenCV will be used in conjunction with a Convolutional Neural Network running on an auxiliary Vision Processing Unit connected to the Raspberry Pi.

The completion of this research work will help shape the future of assistive technologies to facilitate the independent navigation of visually impaired individuals. Further, the completed research work will result in the creation of an open image dataset relevant to the African context and so further inclusion in the development of artificial intelligence.
